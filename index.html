      <p>My name is Darlene Leslie. I am a proud graduate of Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado. I graduated with a B.A. in Interdisciplinary 
        Studies in 2008. With my degree, I was able to study law, art, education, and Native American studies. In 2009, I received a Dr. Linda Ekmann Simmon's Award
        for Outstanding Native American Student in Education. In 2011, I returned to Arizona to continue my journey as an elementary teacher. While I worked with
        Mesa Public Schools, I became a part of the Montessori program. In 2016, I became a certified Montessori teacher accredited by the American Montessori 
        Society. As an educator, I recognized the growing interest in technology and completed a full stack web development program with the University of Arizona in 2018.</p> 
      <p>I enjoy helping others and have a passion for learning.</p>
