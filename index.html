      <p>Hello. My name is Darlene Leslie. I was born and raised in Arizona. I have a family of five. My two youngest
        children are continuing their elementary education, while my oldest has just started jr. high school.
        My husband and I have been married for, four years. He is now working toward a degree within the
        environmental sciences.</p>
    <p>I have a diverse background. I graduated with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Studies
        from Fort Lewis College. With this degree, I was able to dabble in biology, art, law, and education.
        My endorsement focus was elementary education K-6. I started teaching public education, in 2014.
        My interest grew with the Montessori Method. As a result, I went through formal training and became
        a certified Montessori teacher with the American Montessori Society. I enjoy teaching kids using
        the Montessori Method. My long term goal is to work with the Native American community in building
        Montessori schools. I found an interest in computer coding because I felt that it would be helpful
        with developing communication tools for the public, teachers, and adminstrators. I've completed
        my computer coding training, in December, from the University of Arizona.</p>
    <p>Besides my passion for learning, I love to hike, dance, and spend time with my family.</p>
